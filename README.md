# Claim Balances (an extension of Factions)

The idea behind this plugin is to allow users to have different balances of power on a per-world basis,
instead of the current system where power is shared across worlds.

For example:

     Player A joins the server for the first time and joins world 1.
     Player A starts with a balance of 15 claims and decides to claim 10 chunks.
     Player A now has 5 claims left in world 1.
     Player A leaves world 1 and hops onto world 2.
     Player A starts with a balance of 15 claims, for world 2, and decides to claim 5 chunks.
     Player A now has 5 claims left in world 1 and 10 claims left in world 2.
